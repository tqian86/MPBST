# MPBST
**M**assively **P**arallel **B**ayesian **S**tatistics **T**oolkit is a collection of statistical models implemented with available Cython and OpenCL optimizations.

## Dependencies
MPBST depends on [clsampler](https://github.com/tqian86/clsampler). Please setup your python environment in a way that `import clsampler` works.

## Warning
The `master` repository will always lag behind the newest branches. Browse different branches (which are usually intuitively named) to get a sense of what's under active development.

A more detailed README will be added to document the usage of this package when at least some statistical models are stable enough for general use.
